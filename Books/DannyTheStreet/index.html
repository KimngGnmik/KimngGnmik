        <h2 class="book-title">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          <em>Danny the Street</em> is a surreal murder mystery narrated by Danny — a kid who died under 
          suspicious circumstances and came back as a street. Literally. Asphalt, curb, crosswalks, the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The town paved over him and moved on. Danny didn’t. He’s still here, still watching, still trying to 
          figure out who killed him and why the town seems determined to pretend nothing happened.
        </p>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top:22px;">What the Story Actually Is</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Danny can’t move like a ghost or talk like a person. He can only do what a street can do:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left:1.2rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">shift his layout by a few feet, just enough to make someone uneasy,</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">bend the route of a parade or delivery truck,</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">flicker streetlights, stall crosswalk signals,</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">force people to walk past things they’d rather avoid.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Most people chalk it up to bad municipal planning. But one person — your narrator — notices every detail 
          Danny tries to communicate, because they were the last person to see Danny alive.
        </p>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top:22px;">Tone & Structure</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The tone blends quiet humor with creeping dread. The town itself feels polite but wrong, like a place 
          where everyone remembers something they refuse to say out loud. As the narrator follows the clues Danny 
          leaves, the story shifts from quirky small-town oddities to a layered investigation:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left:1.2rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">On the surface: funny, surreal episodes of a town adapting to a sentient street.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">Underneath: patterns Danny is trying to reveal — people he herds together, places he avoids, places he insists the narrator visits.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.4rem;">At the core: the truth about Danny’s death and why the town needed him gone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top:22px;">Danny’s Abilities</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Danny isn’t omnipotent — he’s asphalt. His power is subtle and maddening:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left:1.2rem;">
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">He can reroute joggers by changing the slope of the sidewalk.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">He can “forget” to let a car turn until the driver gives up.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:0.35rem;">He can draw attention to ignored corners via signage that shouldn’t exist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="book-desc">
          It’s not magic. It’s persistence. It’s the stubborn will of someone who refuses to stay buried under concrete.
        </p>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top:28px;">Table of Contents</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          A chapter-by-chapter index will go here later. Each chapter will focus on a specific location Danny 
          manipulates — the pet shop, the festival route, the street that shortens at night — and how each 
          one uncovers a piece of his death.
