        <h2 class="book-title">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          This project isn’t a retelling of Harry’s story so much as a deep prequel that lives in the same
          universe. It’s set centuries before the main series and focuses on the origins of the Deathly
          Hallows, the idea of “Master of Death,” and what it would actually mean for someone to carry that
          title over a long stretch of history. Instead of school-years hijinks, the story follows adults
          dealing with plague, war, and the slow, messy consequences of magic.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          At the center of it is a wandering healer who stumbles into time magic and wandlore he doesn’t
          fully understand. He’s not a Chosen One; he’s stubborn, tired, and trying to keep people alive in
          a world where both disease and wizards can kill you. His path crosses with early wandmakers,
          obscure magical families, and the first whispers of the Hallows, pulling him into a long chain of
          bargains and mistakes that echo forward into the canon era.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The point of the rewrite is to:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Treat magic as a system with limits, costs, and history—not just a set of convenient spells.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Ground the Hallows and “Master of Death” in something that feels psychologically and morally
            heavy, rather than a simple power-up.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Explore how wizarding culture evolved before Hogwarts-as-we-know-it, especially during
            plague-era Europe.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top: 22px;">Book 1 – <em>Gregor of the Wands</em></h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The first arc, tentatively titled <em>Gregor of the Wands</em>, is set in a small town during a
          devastating plague. The healer arrives hoping to help, but quickly realizes that what’s killing
          people isn’t only disease—there are rumors of a wand that “chooses” its master a little too
          aggressively, and a local wandmaker whose work may be tied to something older and more dangerous.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          This section of the story:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Introduces the healer, his relationship to time magic, and why he’s already wary of anything
            that promises power without cost.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Follows a wandmaker whose craft edges up against the kind of legend that eventually becomes the
            Elder Wand myth.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Uses the plague as a pressure cooker for moral choices: who gets healed, what line you cross to
            save someone, and what it does to you when you can’t.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top: 22px;">Future Directions</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Later arcs will push the healer further through time and deeper into the Hallows’ orbit: watching
          how stories mutate into legend, how different owners interpret the idea of “Master of Death,” and
          how someone who has seen too many lifetimes decides what kind of ending they’re willing to accept.
          The goal is to weave through familiar canon touchpoints without being trapped by them—more
          “shadow history” than direct retcon.
        </p>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top: 28px;">Table of Contents</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          I’ll eventually add a chapter-by-chapter table of contents here for <em>Gregor of the Wands</em>,
          with short notes on each chapter and how it fits into the larger Hallows storyline.
