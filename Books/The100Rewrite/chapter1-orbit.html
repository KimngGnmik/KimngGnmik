        <h2 class="book-title">Chapter One: Orbit</h2>
        <p class="book-desc"><strong>Polaris Station | December 2nd, 2052</strong></p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Becca’s reflection wavered gently on the curved observation window, Earth stretching out behind her like a
          luminous painting—vast, alive, and impossibly close. Sweeping arcs of ocean and cloud filled the frame, the
          surface split cleanly between day and night. On one side, sunrise crept across the curve of the planet,
          gilding the edge in soft gold. On the other, darkness clung to the land like a heavy veil, broken by the
          scattered shimmer of city lights, tiny clusters of life still blinking in the dark. Beyond that lay the void
          cloaking the other worlds; planets, moons, and stars by the billions, but none (as far as anyone could prove)
          carried life. Not like this one.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          And yet, if she stared long enough into that darkness, she could find the faintest signs of human presence.
          Tiny pulses of light, scattered at impossible distances, marked the twelve other stations drifting in low
          orbit, caught in Earth’s gravity like Polaris. One of those pulses appeared just above the horizon, faint but
          unwavering. Becca knew it by position alone – Europa Station. Six kilometers long and layered like a stack of
          mismatched modules, it was the largest and oldest of the twelve orbiting stations. Built by a fragile
          coalition of European nations back when orbital expansion was still a shared dream, it had since grown into
          its own sprawling silhouette against the stars. From here, it was nothing more than a pinprick of light, no
          brighter than an aircraft blinking through distant clouds.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Six minutes since Europa last appeared. She’d timed it, of course, she always did. It should be sliding into
          view any moment now. She fixed her gaze on the dark edge of the horizon and waited. The seconds stretched, one
          by one, like the ticking of a clock she couldn’t hear. Her breath ghosted faintly on the glass.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          There. A small flare of light blinked into existence. Europa, right on time. She let her gaze follow that
          distant point, tracking the slow, steady arc it made along its orbit.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “...and Becca can walk you through how A.L.I.E. modeled the serum’s performance under variable radiation
          exposure.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          The sound of her name snapped her back. She blinked, the pale reflection of her face suddenly sharpening
          against the glass, and turned toward her monitor. Chris filled the center frame, early thirties with dark hair
          that fell in a slight wave across his forehead and a lean, angular face. His expression carried an easy
          confidence, the kind that came from someone used to holding a room’s attention. Even through the screen, there
          was a sharpness to his gaze, attentive and direct.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          He was still talking, walking the review board through last night’s simulations, and she’d been staring out the
          window for who knew how long. Hoping no one had noticed, she straightened in her chair. The LED beside her
          webcam was glowing. On. Definitely on.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          She clicked through the meeting’s participant list until she found her own feed, quietly bargaining with the
          universe for grainy video. No luck. The image was unforgivingly clear. She saw herself in a tiny window of the
          screen, faint shadows under her eyes, her auburn hair pulled into a loose bun with a few rebellious strands
          curling along her temple. Even the soft glow from overheads didn’t hide the tiredness in her face. The camera
          caught everything. The small freckle just above the corner of her lip. The crease in her lab coat where she’d
          shrugged it on without buttoning it properly.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Her focus seemed to sit just behind her eyes instead of in them. She looked exactly how she felt: worn thin,
          running on caffeine and habit.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “...Becca?”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          She toggled her mic on, forcing the corners of her mouth upward.
          “Right. Thanks, Chris.” She kept her voice even. Professional. “As of this morning, A.L.I.E. completed the
          latest round of predictive modeling on the Radiation Resistance Augmentation Serum, RRAS for short. We’re
          seeing consistent results across all trial parameters.” She pulled up the data overlay, letting the numbers
          speak first. “In simulated environments matching Kepler-442b’s radiation profile, roughly 2.3 times Earth’s
          background levels, subjects treated with the current serum iteration showed a 94% reduction in cellular damage
          markers over a six-month exposure period. That’s DNA strand breaks, oxidative stress, and bone marrow
          suppression all within acceptable tolerances.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          A few tiles on her screen shifted, faces leaning in, taking notes. Good. She had their attention.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “RRAS works through three primary mechanisms,” she continued. “Enhanced melanin production for surface-level
          protection, amplified DNA repair enzyme expression to counter cumulative damage, and targeted antioxidant
          synthesis to prevent cascading cell death. A.L.I.E.’s been running iterative models to optimize the balance
          between those three systems, and we’re seeing diminishing returns on melanin enhancement past a certain
          threshold. So the latest build shifts resources towards repair mechanisms instead.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          She paused, checking the reaction tiles. Still engaged.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “More importantly, A.L.I.E.’s now incorporating long-term metabolic projections. The serum doesn’t just protect
          against radiation, it alters how the body processes oxygen and nutrients under stress. That means we can start
          modeling mission profiles beyond just landing survival. We’re talking sustained habitation. Months, maybe
          years, depending on how the surface trials go.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          One of the tiles unmuted, a man from logistics. His voice clipped, “And RRAS is stable? No degradation during
          transit?”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Stable at minus eighty Celsius for up to eighteen months,” Becca replied. “We’ve stress tested it through
          simulated launch conditions, microgravity, and temperature fluctuations. It holds.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Side effects?”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Fatigue during the first 72 hours post injection. Mild immune suppression for about a week while the body
          adjusts. Nothing that would compromise mission readiness, and A.L.I.E.’s factored those variables into the crew
          rotation schedules.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Chris’s voice cut back in, smooth and steady. “Which brings us to the integration point. A.L.I.E.’s not just
          modeling the serum’s performance in isolation, she’s running full mission simulations with treated personnel.
          Environmental hazards, equipment failures, solar flare events. The goal is to know, before anyone sets foot on
          the surface, exactly what they’ll be capable of and where the failure points are.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “And she’s learning,” Becca added. “The adaptive decision matrix lets her refine predictions in real time. If
          something unexpected happens – say, a habitat breach combined with a radiation spike – she can reprioritize
          survival protocols on the fly. That’s the kind of flexibility you need when you’re thirty-two days from home
          and there’s no backup coming.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Silence followed. Not uncomfortable, but weighty. The kind that meant people were thinking, calculating.
          Finally, a voice from the back of the participant list. Administrator Walsh, her tone carefully neutral.
          “Promising work. Both of you. But promising doesn’t get funding. Shakti’s already running decent trials,
          Tiangong-7 and Europa are adding two habitat modules this quarter. What’s our timeline for boots on the
          ground?”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Chris glanced off-screen, then back. “Eighteen months to RRAS deployment readiness. Another six for
          environmental model verification and crew training. Call it two years, conservatively.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Two years,” Walsh repeated. “And by then, someone else has already planted a flag.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Maybe,” Chris said evenly. “But they’ll be planting it blind. We’re not racing to be the first. We’re racing
          for survival.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Another pause. Longer this time.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “We’ll see if Congress agrees with that philosophy,” Walsh said. “Moving on to budget allocation. Director Wu,
          you have the floor.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Becca muted her mic and leaned back in her chair, feeling the tension settle between her shoulder blades.
          Outside the window, Europa had already slipped out of sight, leaving nothing but the curve of the planet and
          the dark beyond.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Wu’s image filled the central tile, neat suit, dark hair pulled back. Voice sharp and precise. “Projected
          quarterly expenditure is stable but forward projections require a 6.4% increase to maintain current timelines.
          Hardware upgrades for Polaris’s simulation core, 1.8%. Software licensing and compute time for A.L.I.E.’s
          training cycles, 1.4%. The adaptive matrix demands high volume processing and her learning can’t be paused
          without degrading performance.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Becca could hear a faint mumbling, “Her. it’s an AI.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Biological adaptation research, 1.1%. This includes ongoing RRAS trials, metabolic efficiency testing, and
          oxygen adaptation protocols. Field operations, 1.5%. That covers atmospheric entry vehicles, pilot training,
          and initial deployment kits for Kepler-442b. Transit time is thirty-two days under optimal conditions,
          requiring a 7% fuel margin for course corrections.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Someone from propulsion groaned. “Seven percent’s aggressive.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “It’s necessary,” Wu replied. “Fuel reserves are already tight after Brazil suspended export licenses last
          quarter. We’re sourcing from alternate suppliers, but costs are up. The remaining allocation covers surface
          operations: habitat modules, water reclamation, emergency extraction. These aren’t optional.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          “Europa just doubled their descent budget,” a voice cut in. “They’ll be on the surface before we’ve even
          finished hazard mapping. And I’ve heard Kibo-II has already added two modules in six months. If they skip full
          simulations, they could land first.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Becca kept her mic muted. The word ‘competition’ always tightens something in her chest. These weren’t launch
          windows. They were lives. Watching the speaking icons flare and fade. No one was asking for her input,
          scientists never got the floor during budget fights. But every credit cut from the environmental model was one
          less hazard scenario she could test. One more blindspot before someone bet their lives on her work.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Walsh cleared her throat. “Environmental model expansion will receive a 10% increase this quarter, pending
          review. Operations will provide a revised allocation schedule by end of week. Next meeting we’ll revisit
          resource sharing with the Pacific Coalition. You all know your assignments. That’s all.”
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          One by one, the tiles began winking out. Names and faces disappearing into black squares. Becca waited until
          the last few were gone before killing her own feed. The sudden quiet felt heavier without the constant murmur
          of voices. She let her head fall back against the chair, eyes closing. The afterimage of the budget fight still
          lingered in her mind.
        </p>

        <p class="book-desc">
          Ten percent more wasn’t enough. But it would have to be. The hum of the station pressed in around her. Steady,
          low, almost lulling. Outside, Earth kept turning, unbothered. For the first time all day, she didn’t fight it.
        </p>
