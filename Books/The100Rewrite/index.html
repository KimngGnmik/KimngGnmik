        <h2 class="book-title">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          This is a long-form rewrite of <em>The 100</em> that keeps the emotional core of the show but rebuilds
          the scaffolding underneath it. I’m keeping the broad premise—humanity surviving in orbit after a
          nuclear apocalypse—but tightening the science, clarifying the politics, and giving character choices
          cleaner cause-and-effect. Instead of jumping straight into the dropship, the story starts years earlier
          and follows the people who actually built the world that Clarke and the others inherit.
        </p>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The goal isn’t to “fix” everything or write a perfect version; it’s to create a version that feels
          internally consistent to me. That means:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Making the space program, stations, and political alliances feel like real long-term projects,
            not just set dressing.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Letting technology like A.L.I.E. and the Nightblood serum grow out of believable research,
            trade-offs, and failures.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            Giving key characters clear strengths, flaws, and through-lines so their big decisions feel earned
            instead of convenient.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top: 22px;">Book 1 – <em>The 5</em></h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          The first book, <em>The 5</em>, is a prequel set in the years leading up to the apocalypse. It follows
          multiple points of view whose choices quietly set up the world of the main series:
        </p>
        <ul class="book-desc" style="margin-left: 1.2rem; padding-left: 0;">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            <strong>Becca Franko</strong> aboard Polaris Station, refining A.L.I.E. and getting drawn into the
            early radiation-resistance research that will eventually become Nightblood.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            <strong>Callie Cadogan</strong> on Earth, growing up inside her father’s doomsday cult and slowly
            realizing that his “salvation” plan has a cost.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            <strong>Peri</strong>, a medic on Polaris and Becca’s closest friend, who becomes the emotional
            anchor of the station storyline.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 0.4rem;">
            <strong>Jonah and Mara</strong>, a quiet newlywed couple stationed on Europa, whose seemingly
            small personal story intersects with decisions being made far above their pay grade.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Instead of treating the apocalypse as a sudden backdrop event, this book treats it as the end of a
          long chain of understandable choices—scientific, political, and personal. By the time the bombs fall,
          the goal is for it to feel tragic but inevitable, not random.
        </p>

        <h2 class="book-title" style="margin-top: 22px;">Future Books</h2>
        <p class="book-desc">
          Later books will move into reimagined versions of the main <em>The 100</em> storyline: the dropship
          landing, Mount Weather, A.L.I.E., Praimfaya, and beyond. Each arc keeps the big questions of the
          original—what we’re willing to do to survive, what we owe each other, and what “doing better”
          actually looks like—while giving the world and its timelines a sharper, more grounded spine.
