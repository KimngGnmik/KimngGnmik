        <p>
          I write these stories for myself—out of the simple impulse to take worlds I enjoy and explore
          the versions that make the most sense to me. When I connect with a piece of media, I almost
          always end up imagining different angles: threads that could have gone deeper, character choices
          that deserved more weight, or worldbuilding that feels richer with a bit more structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          These projects aren’t meant for publication. They’re personal rewrites and narrative
          experiments—places where I can pull apart a story, rebuild it, and see how it changes when the
          logic is strengthened or the characters are given room to grow. Some ideas stay close to the
          source; others drift into something new. What connects them all is the freedom to write without
          deadlines, expectations, or the constraints of canon.
        </p>

        <p>
          This section collects the worlds I’m currently exploring: reimagined versions of familiar
          stories, and a few original ones shaped by the same curiosity. They’re not final products—they’re
          long-form creative spaces where I learn, experiment, and build the stories I want to read.

          <h2 class="book-title">The 100 Rewrite</h2>
          <p class="book-desc">
            A reimagining of The 100 that rebuilds its world from the ground up—focusing on coherent
            science, stronger character motivations, and a clearer chain of events leading into the
            original story. This version expands on the political tensions, technological decisions,
            and personal flaws that shape the apocalypse, exploring how small choices accumulate into
            the world we eventually see.

          <h2 class="book-title">The Harry Potter Rewrite</h2>
          <p class="book-desc">
            A dark, grounded story set centuries before the Harry Potter era, following a wandering healer
            whose search for a cure to the plague leads him into the origins of the Deathly Hallows.
            Blending medieval history, time travel, wandlore, and the cost of magic, the story explores
            how one man’s grief shapes the future of wizardkind.

          <h2 class="book-title">Danny the Street</h2>
          <p class="book-desc">
            An original mystery narrated by someone who is not entirely alive, set in a town whose streets
            behave like sentient beings. Blending subtle surrealism with quiet humor, the story follows
            a narrator trying to make sense of a place that rearranges itself, hides secrets, and reacts
            to the people living in it.
